# 100DaysOfCode (Starting from June 1, 2021)
Repository for #100DaysOfCode. This repo will contain the solutions to the questions I solve and their approach for future reference.

Day 1- Started with Linked List. Solved 8 questions of linked list (find middle, reverse list, check palindrome, reorder list, merge two sorted lists, remove duplicates from sorted lists, linked list sorting, merge K sorted lists)

Day 2- Solved 6 questions of linked list (detect linked list, find the node where linked list cycle begins, find the node where two linked lisst intersect, remove Nth node from the end, reverse linked list in a given range, segregate even and odd nodes in a linked list)

Day 3- Solved 3 questions of linked list (reverse nodes in k group, copy list with random pointer, LRU cache)

Day 4- Started with Stacks. Solved 9 questions of stacks (next greater on right, next greater on left, next smaller on right, next smaller on left, next greater element II, stock span, online stock span, valid parentheses sequence, valid stack sequence)

Day 5- Solved 3 questions of Stacks (minimum remove to make valid parentheses, asteroid collision, largest rectangle in histogram)
